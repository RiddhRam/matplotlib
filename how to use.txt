NOTES:
After running graph.py, the x-axis might still be labeled as 'X', 
this is fixed after running VideoMaker.py since it draws the correct label over it

For videos with 1 single line, set car colors 1 and 2 to #282c44 and make all data points the same

Steps:
Copy data from spreadsheets and change other values in interoplate.py.

Then run graph.py, counter.py and legend.py.
In graph.py the maximumY var may need to be changed sometimes. 

Then run MainVideoMaker.py
Then run LastFrameMaker.py
Then run FinalVideo.py

Then import video into capcut and then export just to make sure video is compatible with all platforms
