NOTES:
After running graph.py, the x-axis and y-axis won't have any label,
this is fixed after running MainVideoMaker.py since it draws the correct labels

For videos with 1 single line, set car colors 1 and 2 to #282c44 and make all data points the same
If only 1 car, dont use the legend.py, use the text that follows the lines

Steps:
Drop table_data.csv into project folder.

Run interpolate.py
Then run graph.py, counter.py and legend.py.
In graph.py the maximumY var may need to be changed sometimes. 

IMPORTANT: RUN IN THIS EXACT ORDER
Then run MainVideoMaker.py
Then run LastFrameMaker.py

Then import MainVideo.mp4 and LastFrameFinal.mp4 into CapCut
Trim first few frames from MainVideo.mp4 up until the second year shows and the axes look normal

There may be a template already made in CapCut and all you have to do it export it
