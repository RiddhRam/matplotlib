NOTES:
After running graph.py, the x-axis and y-axis won't have any label,
this is fixed after running MainVideoMaker.py since it draws the correct labels
When selecting a frame count, make sure to factor in the length of the last clip which is 30 frames
Also make sure the total frame count is 5 less than the next second for example:
7 seconds and 55 frames is 5 frames less than 8 seconds
This helps the video in the algorithm since it will they always round the time up,
but in this case it will say 8 seconds, instead of 9 seconds, and the actual
length isn't far off. At 7 seconds and 56 frames it will say 9 seconds

For videos with 1 single line, set car colors 1 and 2 to #282c44 and make all data points the same
If only 1 car, dont use the legend.py, use the text that follows the lines

Steps:
Drop table_data.csv into project folder.
Make sure to change the name of the vehicles in the csv.
In interpolate.py, change the logo values to the names of the according vehicle logo file names in the Logos folder

Run interpolate.py
Either run SingleGraph.py or ComparisonGraph.py depending on how many vehicles (SingleGraph.py for 1, ComparisonGraph.py for more than 1)
Then run counter.py
If running ComparisonGraph.py then run legend.py as well

In graph.py the maximumY var may need to be changed sometimes to fit all lines into the graph

IMPORTANT: RUN IN THIS EXACT ORDER

Either run SinglePricePredictor.py or PriceComparisons.py depending on how many vehicles
Then run LastFrameMaker.py

Then import MainVideo.mp4 and LastFrameFinal.mp4 into CapCut
Trim first few frames from MainVideo.mp4 up until the second year shows and the axes look normal
